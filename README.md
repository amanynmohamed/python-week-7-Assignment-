# Iris Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of the Iris dataset using Python libraries such as *Pandas* for data manipulation and *Matplotlib* for data visualization.

## Steps Included:
1. *Loading the Dataset*: Loaded the Iris dataset from a CSV file.
2. *Data Cleaning*: Handled missing values (if any).
3. *Basic Statistics*: Analyzed basic statistical measures like mean, median, and standard deviation.
4. *Data Visualization*: Created various plots including line charts, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots to visualize the data.

## Libraries Used:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn (for enhanced visualization)

## Conclusion:
The dataset was analyzed to understand the distribution of features such as Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width, and their relationships across different species of Iris flowers.
